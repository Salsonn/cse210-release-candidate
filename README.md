# cse210-final **Dino Dash**
There's no time to explain! Grab a weapon and defend yourself from the angry dinosaurs! Most importantly don't let them touch you!

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and python Arcade installed 
and running on your machine. You can install Arcade by opening a terminal 
and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install arcade
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the 
project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 rfk 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE 
and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and 
click the "run" icon.
